Title: A Time Series Pattern Query Tool Using PIPs and Hybrid Template-Ruleset Matching
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Joshua Anthony Marsh
Maintainer: Joshua Anthony Marsh <joshanthonymarsh@gmail.com>
Description: Allows for the querying of time series for patterns. TSPatternQuery is a slightly modified implementation of <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1862263>. This is a sliding window algorithm. Important points are identified within the window at each offset. They are then compared to a template of the desired pattern using spearman's rho as a similarity measure. Additional rules provided to the function may be used to increase accuracy, or to short circuit the algorithm in order to increase speed.
