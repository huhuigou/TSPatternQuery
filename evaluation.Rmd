#Part 1: Setup

Download RStudio if possible. Open a new session.  At the end of this evaluation, you will be asked to create and send me an .Rhistory file containing a history of everything you've typed during this session. Instructions for this will be given at the end of this document.

#Part 2: Making a Template

Provide data set and instruct them to make a templat which (I know) is an appropriate length to match some patterns in the data.

#Part 3: Window Length and Matching Threshold

Provide a different data set that will not match the pattern unless they adjust the window length. Give them a hint as to what caused the pattern, and what length it should be or something like that.

Have them adjust the spearmans rho threshold until they are satisfied that the patterns returned are good patterns

#Part 4: Distinctive Feature

Provide a dataset (and pattern template) where the pattern has much higher values than the dataset, ask users to try and think of a distinctive feature that will decrease the run time of this query.




#Part X: Questionnaire 

Google form. Your participant ID is: `r sample(1:10000, 1)`. Please type the command savehistory("<participantID>.Rhistory") and email me the file. Do not worry if you refreshed the page and your ID changed, this won't effect anything.
