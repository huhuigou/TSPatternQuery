\title{Check if a Template Pattern Matches a Timeseries}
\usage{
MatchPattern(timeseries, pattern.template, threshold = 0.7)
}
\arguments{
\item{timeseries}{The xts time series to be checked agains the pattern.template to see if it
contains the pattern. Must have the same number of points as the pattern.template}

\item{pattern.template}{An xts time series representation of a pattern. Must have the same
number of points as the timeseries.}

\item{threshold}{The threshold for the spearman's rho. Default is arbitrarily set to 0.7}
}
\value{
TRUE if the spearman ranking correlation coefficient is higher than the set threshold.
}
\description{
If the template pattern matches the timeseries (passing a threshold for Spearman's
Rank Correlation Coefficient), then the timeseries is returned. This function only
considers the y value (i.e. not the time intervals) for matching purposes. It is assumed
that the timeseries covers a similar length of time as the pattern.template.
