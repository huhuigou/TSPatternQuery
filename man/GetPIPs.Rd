\title{Retrieve Perceptually Important Points (PIPS) Within a Time Series}
\usage{
GetPIPs(timeseries, num.pips)
}
\arguments{
\item{timeseries}{The (xts) time series within which PIPS will be identified}

\item{num.pips}{A numeric for the number of PIPs to be identified.}
}
\value{
A vector containing the indexes of the pips in the timeseries provided
}
\description{
Perceptually Important Points (PIPS) are points that are perceptually important for the identification
of patterns in time series data. Each PIP is identified in this function by the choosing the point with
the maximum perpendicular distance to a line drawn between adjacent PIPS. Endpoints of the time series
are chosen as the first PIPS.
