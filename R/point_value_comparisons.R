#value comparison functions

#May not need anything here since this it's easy to compare xts values, so probably don't need to override
#base operators or anything crazy like that. I'll just keep this file here as a placeholder until I've
#thought about it in ore detail.

#possibly from shape definition language, though this may be too forced and it would require them to
#define what up vs Up is somehow....May be easier/cleaner to go without.
up <- function(){}
Up <- function(){}
down <- function(){}
Down <- function(){}
