@article{Poole2016276,
	Abstract = {Abstract Reference intervals are critical for the interpretation of laboratory results. The development of reference intervals using traditional methods is time consuming and costly. An alternative approach, known as an a posteriori method, requires an expert to enumerate diagnoses and procedures that can affect the measurement of interest. We develop a method, LIMIT, to use laboratory test results from a clinical database to identify \{ICD9\} codes that are associated with extreme laboratory results, thus automating the a posteriori method. \{LIMIT\} was developed using sodium serum levels, and validated using potassium serum levels, both tests for which harmonized reference intervals already exist. To test LIMIT, reference intervals for total hemoglobin in whole blood were learned, and were compared with the hemoglobin reference intervals found using an existing a posteriori approach. In addition, prescription of iron supplements were used to identify individuals whose hemoglobin levels were low enough for a clinician to choose to take action. This prescription data indicating clinical action was then used to estimate the validity of the hemoglobin reference interval sets. Results show that \{LIMIT\} produces usable reference intervals for sodium, potassium and hemoglobin laboratory tests. The hemoglobin intervals produced using the data driven approaches consistently had higher positive predictive value and specificity in predicting an iron supplement prescription than the existing intervals. \{LIMIT\} represents a fast and inexpensive solution for calculating reference intervals, and shows that it is possible to use laboratory results and coded diagnoses to learn laboratory test reference intervals from clinical data warehouses. },

@article{Pivovarov201424,
	Abstract = {Abstract Electronic health record (EHR) data show promise for deriving new ways of modeling human disease states. Although \{EHR\} researchers often use numerical values of laboratory tests as features in disease models, a great deal of information is contained in the context within which a laboratory test is taken. For example, the same numerical value of a creatinine test has different interpretation for a chronic kidney disease patient and a patient with acute kidney injury. We study whether \{EHR\} research studies are subject to biased results and interpretations if laboratory measurements taken in different contexts are not explicitly separated. We show that the context of a laboratory test measurement can often be captured by the way the test is measured through time. We perform three tasks to study the properties of these temporal measurement patterns. In the first task, we confirm that laboratory test measurement patterns provide additional information to the stand-alone numerical value. The second task identifies three measurement pattern motifs across a set of 70 laboratory tests performed for over 14,000 patients. Of these, one motif exhibits properties that can lead to biased research results. In the third task, we demonstrate the potential for biased results on a specific example. We conduct an association study of lipase test values to acute pancreatitis. We observe a diluted signal when using only a lipase value threshold, whereas the full association is recovered when properly accounting for lipase measurements in different contexts (leveraging the lipase measurement patterns to separate the contexts). Aggregating \{EHR\} data without separating distinct laboratory test measurement patterns can intermix patients with different diseases, leading to the confounding of signals in large-scale \{EHR\} analyses. This paper presents a methodology for leveraging measurement frequency to identify and reduce laboratory test biases. },
